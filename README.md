🔐 Introduction to Network Security & Database Security Projects
This collection features a variety of hands-on labs and assignments completed during my courses in Network Security and Database Security. These exercises helped me build practical skills in firewall configuration, traffic analysis, and basic penetration testing.

🧱 Firewall and Packet Filtering (iptables)
Configured iptables rules on Kali Linux to:

Block inbound ICMP echo requests (ping)

Deny access to specific domains such as hurmfamilydentistry.com

Drop or reject outbound traffic to selected IPs (e.g., 154.0.153.x)

Verified and documented rule effectiveness using screenshots (see example below):


🌐 Network Traffic Analysis – Wireshark & NetworkMiner
Analyzed a .pcap file (LittlePrince_ghi.pcap) to identify and answer the following:

DNS Queries Made: 2

TCP Streams Created: 6

Frame numbers of file upload (LittlePrince.txt): 33 – 382

TCP Segments used in upload: 377

Destination Hostname: ghi.site90.com

Involved IP Addresses: 192.168.1.66, 31.170.162.223

Extracted file content from TCP stream and captured for reporting

🧪 MySQL and Database Security Pentesting
Conducted SQL vulnerability assessments on test environments

Performed basic database enumeration and login testing

💻 Windows Security – SID & PowerShell Lab
Used WMIC command to retrieve the SID of the current user on Windows Server

Captured and annotated output to verify identity-related configuration

Practiced security auditing tasks using PowerShell and command-line tools

These projects gave me foundational experience in securing systems, analyzing network activity, and understanding how vulnerabilities can be tested and mitigated.
